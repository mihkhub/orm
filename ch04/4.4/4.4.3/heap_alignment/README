If some of the variables are not appropriately aligned as specified, you can align
them using the C algorithm.
p=0x19c4010
newp=0x19c4048

The algorithm aligns a array of 64-bit elements on a 64-bit boundary.
The constant of 7 is derived from one less than the number of bytes in a 64-bit
element, or 8-1.

Another way to improve data alignment is to copy the data into locations that are aligned on 64-bit
boundaries. When the data is accessed frequently, this can provide a significant performance
improvement.
